My recent collaboration with [Yong Zeng's group at Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/faculty/yong-zeng.html) has resulted in a new publication in Scientific Reports: 
[Network Oscillations imply the highest cognitive workload and lowest cognitive control during idea generation in open-ended creation tasks](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-03577-1?proof=t)

The open-ended creation task experiment designed by Yong and his group showed that microstate oscillations (described [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811917305347) and [here](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fninf.2018.00030/full)) are modulated during different cognitive activities, and that the microstate entropy rate indicates the balance between cognitive workload and cognitive control.
