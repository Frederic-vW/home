A three-course specialization Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Graded programming exercises and projects are in notebook format and additional
Colab notebooks are available.  

**Programming language**: Python (pytorch)

**Price**: 69 AUD per month but the first 7 days are a free trial period. 
I was lucky enough to complete the 3 courses in 7 days so it came for free, eventually. 

**Content**:
- Course 1: Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks (approx. 36h)
- Course 2: Build Better Generative Adversarial Networks (approx. 33h)
- Course 3: Apply Generative Adversarial Networks (approx. 31h)
