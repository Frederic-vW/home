The NHMRC has funded the Brain-BaDGE project (PI: Gary Housley) at the [TNF](https://medicalsciences.med.unsw.edu.au/research/groups/translational-neuroscience-facility)!
Over the next four years, we will develop a platform for localized brain gene therapy, ‘Brain-BaDGE’, from proprietary UNSW electric field-focusing technology. 
This translational program will produce a first-for-human ‘needle-like’ medical device for electrotransfer of therapeutic DNA encoding a neuromodulator targeted to groups of neurons in the brain to suppress epileptic seizures of focal origin. 
This Brain-BaDGE platform will establish a translational pathway for gene therapies treating localized brain disorders.
