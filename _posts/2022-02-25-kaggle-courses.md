As I am planning to use more computational notebooks (Jupyter, Python) for my online teaching in physiology and neuroscience, 
I completed the Kaggle ML short courses over the last few weeks. The learning units are very concise and accompanied by notebooks with unit
tests to verify student code. Digital certificates are given upon successful completion of all notebooks.  

Available courses are:
1. [Python](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python) (approx. 5h)
2. [Pandas](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas) (approx. 4h)
3. [Data Cleaning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-cleaning) (approx. 4h)
4. [Data Visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/data-visualization) (approx. 4h)
5. [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) (approx. 3h)
6. [Intermediate Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning) (approx. 4h)
7. [Intro to Deep Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-deep-learning) (approx. 4h)
8. [Computer Vision](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/computer-vision) (approx. 4h)
9. [Intro to Game AI and Reinforcement Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-game-ai-and-reinforcement-learning) (approx. 4h)
10. [Feature Engineering](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/feature-engineering) (approx. 5h)
11. [Machine Learning Explainability](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/machine-learning-explainability) (approx. 4h)
12. [Intro to AI Ethics](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-ai-ethics) (approx. 4h)
13. [Time Series](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/time-series) (approx. 5h)
14. [Geospatial Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/geospatial-analysis) (approx. 4h)
