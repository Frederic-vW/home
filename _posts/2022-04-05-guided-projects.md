Guided projects on Coursera are quick learning projects for people with programming experience and who already have acquired the 
background knowledge for the given topic. The screen is split in a teacher and a student view and the student copies the teacher's steps 
to complete the notebook. The projects are concise, fast-paced and you have a notebook with a working example when completed. They come at 9 AUD each.
