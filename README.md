# Computational Physiology at the Translational Neuroscience Facility

The [Translational Neuroscience Facility](https://medicalsciences.med.unsw.edu.au/research/groups/translational-neuroscience-facility) at [UNSW Sydney](https://www.unsw.edu.au/) runs a computational theme, covering the following topics:
- Computational analysis of EEG (electroencephalography) activity patterns (waves, phase patterns)
- EEG microstate analysis
- Computational models of neural activity
- Time-series analysis of cardio-respiratory data
- Stochastic simulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> cellular signals
